This is a Python file for the task. I'm extremely sorry for not building a proper application. My semester exams have started already and I am also appearing for CAT which is on 24th Nov, Friday. 

The code and logic is however effective. And the code generates an Inverted Index Data Structure successfully. 

It takes input of the PDF document and then takes input of the word to be searched. 

I sincerely apologize.
